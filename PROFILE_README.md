## Hi, I'm Gantogtokh (Oganaa) ðŸ‘‹

Software Developer (5+ years) building high-quality mobile and web apps. I focus on Flutter, Clean Architecture, and developer experience at scale.

- Portfolio: https://portfolio-kohl-phi-92.vercel.app/
- Currently: Improving Flutter TDD & Clean Architecture workflows
- Open to: Mobile roles (Flutter), fullâ€‘stack with strong UI focus

### Tech
- Flutter, Dart, BLoC/Cubit, Clean Architecture, TDD
- REST APIs, HTTP, GetIt (DI), dartz (Either)
- CI/CD, GitHub Actions, basic AWS, testing & automation

### Featured projects
- wash_service â€” Flutter Clean Architecture starter
  - Code: https://github.com/oganaa2472/wash_service
- tdd_tutorial â€” Flutter TDD with BLoC/Cubit + DI (this repo)
  - Code: https://github.com/oganaa2472/tdd_tutorial
- codepipeline-react â€” CI/CD sample (fork)
  - Code: https://github.com/oganaa2472/codepipeline-react
- codepipeline-nodejs â€” CI/CD sample (fork)
  - Code: https://github.com/oganaa2472/codepipeline-nodejs

### What I value
- Simple, maintainable solutions with clear boundaries
- Testable code: usecases, repositories, and pure functions
- Strong UX: fast feedback, empty states, and accessibility

### How I build Flutter apps
I use a layered architecture (Presentation â†’ Domain â†’ Data):
- Presentation: Views/Widgets + State (Cubit/BLoC)
- Domain: Usecases, Entities, Repositories (abstract)
- Data: Repository implementations, Models, Data sources (HTTP)

I wire dependencies with GetIt, use dartz for Result types, and emphasize small/useful tests around models and usecases.
